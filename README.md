## 📡 AI-Driven Optimization of 5G Resource Allocation

*Machine Learning for Smarter, Faster & Efficient 5G Networks*

---

## 📘 **Project Description**

The **AI-Driven Optimization of 5G Resource Allocation** project introduces an intelligent system that enhances how resources—such as bandwidth, latency thresholds, and signal strength—are managed in 5G networks.

5G networks face challenges like:

* Massive device density
* Real-time traffic fluctuations
* Diverse application QoS needs
* High data consumption

Traditional static allocation techniques struggle to keep up with these dynamic requirements.

This project uses **machine learning** to create a **predictive and adaptive resource allocation model** that improves:

* Efficiency
* Throughput
* Stability
* User experience

### 🔍 **What the System Does**

* Processes 5G network performance data
* Learns traffic patterns & resource behavior
* Predicts optimal resource allocation
* Ensures minimal latency & congestion
* Enhances service quality across applications

### 🔧 **Core Concepts Involved**

* Data preprocessing & feature engineering
* ML model comparison (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* Performance analysis
* Flask-based prediction interface

The final system supports telecom operators in making **data-driven allocation decisions**, helping networks adapt in real time.
